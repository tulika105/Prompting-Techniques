# Prompting Techniques in AI Language Models

This repository outlines techniques for crafting effective prompts to guide AI language models, such as GPT, and explains different prompting strategies with clear examples.

## Crafting an Effective Prompt

To ensure the AI model generates accurate and useful responses, follow this structured approach:

1. **Establish Role and High-Level Task Description:**  
   - Clearly define the AI's role and the overall objective in 1-2 sentences.

2. **Dynamic/Retrieved Content for Context:**  
   - Provide any relevant background information or dynamic content to ground the task.

3. **Detailed Task Instructions:**  
   - Break down the task into clear, step-by-step instructions.

4. **Example:**  
   - Include examples to guide the model and clarify expectations.

5. **Repeat Critical Information:**  
   - Reiterate the key points or steps for emphasis.

6. **Prevent Hallucinations:**  
   - State explicitly: "Say 'I don't know' if you don't know the answer or process asked."

This structure ensures clarity, avoids ambiguity, and minimizes hallucination risks in the AI-generated content.

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### 1. Few-Shot Prompting
Provide a few examples of the task to help the model understand the expected pattern and generate outputs accordingly.

**Example:**
```
Translate English to French:

English: Hello, how are you?
French: Bonjour, comment Ã§a va?

English: What is your name?
French: Comment tu t'appelles?

English: I love programming.
French:
```
*Expected Model Output:*  
J'adore programmer.

---

### 2. Zero-Shot Prompting
Simply describe the task without providing examples. The model uses its pre-trained knowledge to perform the task.

**Example:**
```
Translate the following sentence to French:  
"I am learning about AI."
```
*Expected Model Output:*  
J'apprends l'intelligence artificielle.

---

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Encourage the model to reason step-by-step for tasks that require intermediate reasoning.

**Example:**
```
Question: If I have 3 apples and I buy 2 more, then I give 1 to a friend, how many apples do I have left?
Let's think step by step.
```
*Expected Model Output:*  
First, you have 3 apples.  
You buy 2 more, so now you have 5 apples.  
You give 1 to a friend, so you have 4 apples left.  
*Final Answer:* 4 apples.

### 4. Tree of Thought Prompting
Encourage the model to explore multiple reasoning paths before deciding on the best solution.

**Example:**
```
Question: What are possible ways to increase productivity at work? Please explore different options before choosing the best.
```
*Expected Model Output:*  
- Option 1: Implement time management tools.  
- Option 2: Encourage regular breaks.  
- Option 3: Provide training for employees.  
- Option 4: Reduce unnecessary meetings.  

After considering these options, the best way may be to implement time management tools and provide training for employees.

### 5. Meta-Prompting
Guide the model on how to behave or answer, often abstractly, such as asking it to think like an expert or explain its reasoning.

**Example:**
```
You are an expert mathematician. Explain your answer as if teaching a beginner.

Question: What is the derivative of x^2?
```
*Expected Model Output:*  
As an expert mathematician, let me explain:  
The derivative of x^2 with respect to x is found by multiplying the exponent (2) by the coefficient (1) and subtracting one from the exponent.  
So, the derivative is 2x.
